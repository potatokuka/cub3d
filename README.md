Griffin's take aways from this project:

- This should have been obvious at the point in which I made this, but write cleaner more orginized code. I really learned this the hard way during this project.
  I was new, maybe 4 months into coding at this point, and was just too focused on purely getting functionality working, as apposed to writing clear and consice
  code that was generally easier to fix.
